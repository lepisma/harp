Personal health tracker.

Some notes on requirements and abstractions.

Reports should be made based on:
+ Time Duration
+ Tags & Categories
+ Severity
+ Manual Selection

Input mechanism should allow:
+ Test report files
+ Consultation notes
+ Journal entry for symptoms etc.

External log system for things like fitbit:
+ To draw reports

Extra future features:
+ Smart parsing, input, organization, and formatting
+ Semantic / full text search
+ User friendly interface(s)
